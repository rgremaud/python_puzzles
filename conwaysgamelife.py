# Conway’s Game of Life is a cellular automata simulation that
# follows simple rules to create interesting patterns. It was
# invented by mathematician John Conway in 1970 and popularized
# by Martin Gardner’s “Mathematical Games” column in Scientific American.
# Today, it’s a favorite among programmers and computer scientists,
# though it’s more an interesting visualization than a true “game.”
# The two-dimensional board has a grid of “cells,” each of which follows three simple rules:

# Living cells with two or three neighbors stay alive in the next step of the simulation.
# Dead cells with exactly three neighbors become alive in the next step of the simulation.
# Any other cell dies or stays dead in the next step of the simulation.
# The living or dead state of the cells in the next step of the simulation
# depends entirely on their current state. The cells don’t “remember” any older
# states. There is a large body of research regarding the patterns that these
# simple rules produce. Tragically, Professor Conway passed away of complications
# from COVID-19 in April 2020. More information about Conway’s Game of Life can
# be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life, and more
